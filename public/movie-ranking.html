    <h3>Lord of the Rings Triology</h3>
    <img src="../asset/images/LOR-1.jpg" alt="lord of the rings triology image" height="100px">
    <p>This is probably the <em> best triology </em> that ever exists. Crisp, Engaging,and amazing graphics for the time (2001-2003). </p>

    <h3>Transporter</h3>
    <img src="../asset/images/TR-1.jpg" alt="transporter movie image" height="100px">
    <p>Adrenaline rush, nail-biting action sequences, martial arts.. oh! and Jason Statham doing all that with so much ease with his top notch acting skills. If anything Frank Martin should be a Marvel character!</p>

    <h3>Intersteller</h3>
    <img src="../asset/images/INT-1.jpg" alt="intersteller movie image" height="100px">
    <p>The quest to find existence of life has consumed individuals from centuries. This movie deep dives into astro-physics, human emotions, and existence of humans in a beautiful way. It's an absolute must watch.</p>
